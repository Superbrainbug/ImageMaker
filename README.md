# ImageMaker


**Requirements**
*1. You need to have installed one of the Visual Studio versions*

**How is it working**
*Two buttons*
    Firstly, for check if you have in your VirtualBox directory *.dd* file, if not you won't be able to convert anything
    Secondly, if you pass the check of first button, you'll see new created button for generating virtual image from *.dd*
      Wait few secs while magic is happening, and in you */Oracle/VirtualBox/* folder you'll find hardcoded *SI_image.vmdk*
